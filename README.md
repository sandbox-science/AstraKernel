# AstraKernel ~ A minimal ARM kernel for QEMU

[![GitHub release (including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/sandbox-science/AstraKernel?include_prereleases)](https://github.com/sandbox-science/AstraKernel/releases)

AstraKernel is a minimal experimental kernel written in modern C and ARM assembly, designed to run on
**QEMU’s Versatile AB/PB board with a Cortex‑A8 CPU override (-cpu cortex-a8)**. This setup keeps the
simple Versatile peripheral map while enabling **ARMv7‑A** features for experimentation. 
The purpose is educational, showing the fundamental steps of bringing up a bare-metal system, from 
low-level bootstrapping to higher-level interactive features to explore kernel development concepts.

```bash
========================================
  AstraKernel  v0.1.0
  Built Aug 27 2025 at 12:56:35
========================================

  CPU: Cortex-A8 @ 200MHz (simulated)
  RAM: 128MB SDRAM at 0x00000000

Welcome to your own little Astra world!
Type away, explore, have fun.

## Target platform and configuration

- Machine (board): `versatilepb` (or `versatileab`)
- CPU model: `cortex-a8` (via `-cpu cortex-a8`)
- Key peripherals (Versatile map):
  - UART0 (PL011): 0x101F1000
  - Timers (SP804): 0x101E2000
  - Interrupt controller: VIC at 0x10140000
  - SDRAM base: 0x00000000
- Exception vectors: initially at 0x00000000 (32-byte aligned).
  
Later, the kernel may relocate vectors using VBAR once the MMU is enabled.

## Features so far

- [x] **Bootstrapping**: stack setup, BSS clearing, entry into the kernel main.
- [x] **UART I/O**: putc/puts, getc/getline, basic shell loop.
- [x] **Vector Table**: Define vector table for exceptions/interrupts.
- [x] **Basic Timer Interrupt**: Configure one hardware timer, hook its interrupt to increment a "tick" counter.

## Building

### Native Build

Make sure you have an ARM cross-compiler installed (e.g., `arm-none-eabi-gcc`) and `qemu-system-arm`.

```sh
make
```

Developers also have the option to run the kernel with custom flags, such as:
```sh
make KFLAGS="-DUSE_KTESTS -MY_DEFFLAG"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> `make` will clean, build, and run the kernel in QEMU. You can also run 
`make qemu` to run the kernel without cleaning or building it again.

### Docker Build

If you have Docker installed, you can also run AstraKernel through a Docker container:

```sh
make docker
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> `make docker` will pull from the most recent `main` commit from the upstream repository
> `https://github.com/sandbox-science/AstraKernel.git`.
> If you wish to use a local copy, you can run `make docker-dev`, which will copy all
> local build files into the repository.

## Documentation

For more details about this kernel, refer to the [AstraKernel Documentation](https://github.com/sandbox-science/AstraKernel/blob/main/doc/AstraKernelManual.pdf).

> [!NOTE]

> The manual is a work in progress and may not cover all features yet.

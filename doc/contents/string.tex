\subsection{\texttt{strcmp(const char *str\_1, const char *str\_2)}}

\paragraph{Purpose}
Compares two null-terminated strings, character by character.

\paragraph{Overview}
This function compares the characters of two strings (\texttt{ASCII values}), 
\texttt{str\_1} and \texttt{str\_2}, one by one. It returns:

\paragraph{Return Values}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 0 if both strings are equal,
    \item -1 if the first differing character in \texttt{str\_1} is less than that in \texttt{str\_2},
    \item 1 if the first differing character in \texttt{str\_1} is greater than that in \texttt{str\_2}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Behavior}
The comparison stops at the first difference or the null terminator. 
Case sensitivity is observed. Behavior is undefined if either pointer is not a 
valid null-terminated string.

\subsection*{Examples}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C, caption=String Comparison Example]
  int result = strcmp("abc", "abc"); // Expect 0
  printf("Expect 0 -> %d\n", result);

  result = strcmp("abc", "abd"); // Expect -1
  printf("Expect -1 -> %d\n", result);

  result = strcmp("abc", "ABC"); // Expect 1
  printf("Expect 1 -> %d\n", result);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{note}
In the future, we could returning the difference between the first differing 
characters, which would allow for more detailed comparisons. This would enable 
users to understand how far apart the strings are in terms of character values.
